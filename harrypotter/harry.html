                Harry Potter is a popular fictional character and the protagonist of a series of fantasy novels written by British author J.K. Rowling. The book series, known as the "Harry Potter series," has become one of the most successful and beloved literary franchises in the world.

The main storyline follows the life and adventures of Harry James Potter, who discovers that he is a wizard on his eleventh birthday. He learns that he is famous in the wizarding world for surviving an attack by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort when he was just a baby. Voldemort's curse killed his parents, Lily and James Potter, but the curse rebounded upon him when he attempted to kill Harry, leaving Harry with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead and Voldemort weakened.

Harry is then sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a magical school where young witches and wizards are taught magic and other subjects. There, he forms strong friendships with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Together, they embark on numerous adventures, facing various magical creatures, challenges, and dark forces, including Voldemort and his followers, known as Death Eaters.

Throughout the series, Harry's journey involves themes of friendship, love, bravery, and the battle between good and evil. As he grows older, he learns more about his own history, his connection with Voldemort, and the importance of his role in defeating the dark lord.

<li>1. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Philosopher's Stone in some regions)</li>
<li>2. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</li>
<li>3.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</li>

<li>5. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</li>
<li>6. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</li>
<li>7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</li>


The books have been adapted into a highly successful film series, with eight movies released between 2001 and 2011, starring Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.
